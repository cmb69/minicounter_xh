<p style="text-align: justify">Minicounter_XH facilitates counting the visitors of your website.
It's a very minimalistic counter, that will only count the total number of visitors,
but this could be implemented in a very efficient manner, so it's blazingly fast.
Contrary to many other counters Minicounter_XH is session based.</p>

<h2><a name="notice">Important Notice</a></h2>
<p><strong>Minicounter_XH couldn't be tested so far in various environments.
It is a so called release candidate. Use with caution!</strong></p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Minicounter_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH.
It requires a UTF-8 encoded version.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins.
See the <a href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">
CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Backup the data on your server.</strong></li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory minicounter/ to your server to CMSimple_XH's plugins directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories config/, css/ and languages/.</li>
<li><strong>Switch to "Minicounter" in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the minicounter data file could be accessed directly by calling its URL.
A .htaccess file to prohibit this is already contained in the default data folder.
For other servers or for custom data folders you should take care for yourself,
that this file is protected from non authorized access.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other
CMSimple_XH plugins in the website's back-end.
Select "Minicounter" from "Plugins".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Minicounter_XH in "Config".
Hints for the options will be displayed
when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done in "Language".
You can translate the character strings to your own language,
or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<!--<p>The look of Minicounter_XH can be customized in "Stylesheet".</p>-->
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>To display the counter on your website insert on a CMSimple page:</p>
<pre>{{{PLUGIN:minicounter();}}}</pre>
<p>or in the template:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php echo minicounter();?&gt;</pre>
<p>You can change the displayed text in the plugin back-end under "Language".
Please note the text was chosen this way,
as Minicounter_XH doesn't display the actual visitor count,
but insteads keeps a fixed number for every visitor.
You can see the effect, if you surf your site with two different browsers.</p>
<p>Visits in admin mode (including login and logout) are not counted.
Furthermore it's possible to exclude your IP address completely in the configuration.</p>
<p>There's no setting how long a visitor may be inactive
and still be counted as the same visitor.
All that happens transparently through the use of sessions.
As long as the session is active, the visitor will be regarded the same.
When the session will be closed, depends on the session.gc_* PHP settings,
and on the plugin that initially started the session
(usually the session ends at the latest, when the browser is closed).</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
<p><strong>Minicounter_XH is not accurate!</strong>
In fact it is not possible to accurately count visitors (contrary to page hits) on a website at all.
That stems from the fact that in general it's impossible to identify a visitor reliably.
From call to call his IP address may change, if he sits behind a proxy.
And over time IPv4 addresses will change anyway.
The session based approach used by Minicounter_XH is perhaps even more inaccurate,
as it will work only, if the session is accepted by the visitor (typically by accepting the session cookie).
To avoid counting visitors, who don't accept sessions, on every single page hit,
Minicounter_XH counts only those who do,
what's possible only, if they call at least two pages.
IOW: visitors hitting only once won't be counted either.</p>
