<p style="text-align: justify">Minicounter_XH facilitates counting the visitors
of your website. It's a very minimalistic counter, that will only count the
total number of visitors, but this could be implemented in a very efficient
manner by storing the required information temporarily in a PHP session.</p>

<!--<h2 id="notice">Important Notice</h2>-->
<!--<p><strong>Minicounter_XH couldn't be tested so far in various environments.-->
<!--It is a so called release candidate. Use with caution!</strong></p>-->
<!--<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>-->

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>
    Minicounter_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.6.3. It requires PHP ≥ 5.5.0
    with the <i>Session</i> extension.
</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a
href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation"> CMSimple_XH
wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory minicounter/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's
plugins directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectories config/, languages/ and
the configured data folder.</li>
<li>Switch to "Minicounter" in the back-end to check if all requirements are
fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the minicounter data file may be accessed directly by calling its
URL. A .htaccess file to prohibit this is already contained in the default data
folder. For other servers or for custom data folders you should take care for
yourself that this file is protected from non authorized access.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's administration area. Select "Plugins" &rarr; "Minicounter".</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Minicounter_XH under "Config". Hints
for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under "Language". You can translate the character
strings to your own language, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<!--<p>The look of Minicounter_XH can be customized in "Stylesheet".</p>-->
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To display the counter on your website insert on a CMSimple page:</p>
<pre>    {{{PLUGIN:minicounter();}}}</pre>
<p>or in the template:</p>
<pre>    &lt;?php echo minicounter();?&gt;</pre>
<p>You can change the displayed text in the plugin administration under
"Language". Please note the text was chosen this way, because Minicounter_XH
doesn't display the actual visitor count, but insteads keeps a fixed number for
every visitor. You can see the effect, if you access your site with two
different browsers.</p>
<p>Visits in admin mode (including login and logout) are not counted.
Furthermore it's possible to exclude IP addresses completely in the
configuration.</p>
<p>There's no setting how long a visitor may be inactive and still be counted as
the same visitor. All that happens transparently through the use of sessions. As
long as the session is active, the visitor will be regarded the same. When the
session will be closed, depends on the session.gc_* PHP settings and on the
plugin that initially started the session (usually the session ends at the
latest, when the browser is closed).</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li>The usage of visitor trackers may be restricted or even prohibited by laws
for privacy concerns. You can configure Minicounter_XH to honor the DNT (Do Not
Track) flag, what might be sufficient. If in doubt, consult a lawyer.</li>
<li>
<p>Minicounter_XH is not accurate! In fact it is not possible to accurately
count visitors (contrary to page hits) on a website at all. That stems from the
fact that in general it's impossible to identify a visitor reliably. From call
to call his IP address may change, if he sits behind a proxy, and over time IPv4
addresses will change anyway. Other techniques such as browser fingerprinting
and tracking images are not 100% reliable either.</p>
<p>The session based approach used by Minicounter_XH is most likely even more
inaccurate, as it will work only if the session is accepted by the visitor
(typically by accepting the session cookie).</p>
